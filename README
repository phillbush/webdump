webdump
-------

HTML to plain-text converter tool.

It reads HTML in UTF-8 from stdin and writes plain-text to stdout.


Build and install
-----------------

$ make
# make install


Dependencies
------------

- C compiler.
- libc + some BSDisms.


Usage
-----

Example:

	url='https://codemadness.org/sfeed.html'

	curl -s "$url" | webdump -r -b "$url" | less

	curl -s "$url" | webdump -8 -a -i -l -r -b "$url" | less -R

	curl -s "$url" | webdump -s 'main' -8 -a -i -l -r -b "$url" | less -R


Goals / scope
-------------

The tool will only render HTML to stdout, similarly to links -dump or
lynx -dump but simpler and more secure.

- HTML and XHTML will be supported.
- There will be some workarounds and quirks for broken and legacy HTML code.
- It will be usable and secure for reading HTML from mails and RSS/Atom feeds.
- No remote resources which are part of the HTML will be downloaded:
  images, video, audio, etc. But these may be visible as a link reference.
- Data will be written to stdout. Intended for plain-text or a text terminal.
- No support for Javascript, CSS, frame rendering or forms.
- No HTTP or network protocol handling: HTML data is read from stdin.


Features
--------

- Support for word-wrapping.
- A mode to enable basic markup: bold, underline, italic and blink ;)
- Indentation of headers, paragraphs, pre and list items.
- Basic support to query an element or hide them.
- Show link references.
- Show link references and resources such as img, video, audio, subtitles.
- Export link references and resources to a TAB-separated format.


Examples
--------

To use webdump as a HTML filter for example in mutt, change in ~/.mailcap:

	text/html;      /home/user/.config/scripts/mutt/viewhtml.sh %s; copiousoutput; nametemplate=%s.html

The viewhtml.sh could be something like:

	#!/bin/sh
	webdump -r -l < "$1"

In mutt you should then add:

	auto_view text/html
